# Portfolio_Analysis
## Does any portfolio outperform the S&P 500
> All of the whale portfolios outperformed the S&P 500 during the time period measured. 
> It appears the whale portoflio and the Algorithmic trading models outperfomed the S&P 500, which suggests that there can be excess return   captured by the portfolio managers.

## Which Portfolio is more risky than the S&P
> The Berkshire Hathaway and Tiger portfolios have more risk than the S&P 500. Some of the recent changes by Berkshire Hathaway can explain the fact that Warrent Buffet has sustained significant losses in the last year, primarily due to the bank and airline poositions he has, and the relaytiove underweight of "new exconomy" investments that he holds.

## Does the risk increase for each of the portfolios at the same time risk increases in the S&P?
> No it doesn't. None of the portfolios seem to mimic the risk of the S&P 500. The changes in volatilty in each of the portfolios will show random spikes. The fact that the volatility changes do not mirro the S&P 500 can accountfor the fact that the skill of the managers doe add value to teh stock selection and investment process.

## Based on Correlation, Which returns most closely mimic the S&P?
> For the time period selected, none of the returns of the portfolios is correlated to the S&P 500. The closest one is the Paulson and Co portfolio, which is 0nly .0135. Figures in teh range of .7 or higher would indicate siginifcant levels of correlation.

## Choose one portfolio and plot a rolling beta between that portfolio's returns and S&P 500 returns. Does the portfolio seem sensitive to movements n the S&P 500?
> I chose Berkshire Hathawaya nd compared it to the S&P 500 returns. There seems to be no real senstivity of the Berkshire portoflio to the movements in the S&P 500. This can also be seen in the fact gthat the correlations are so low as well.
